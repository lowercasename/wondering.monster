**Alignment** Neutal evil

**HP** 10d10+2 (65)

**Speed** 30 ft., climb 30 ft.

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

**Spider Climb.** The bloodhunger can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Multiattack.** The bloodhunger makes one attack with its legs. If the attack hits, the bloodhunger can make one bite attack against the same target.

**Spined Legs.** _Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature. _Hit_: _13_ (2d10 + 2) piercing damage, and a Medium or smaller target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and the bloodhunger can't attack another target, but has advantage on its attack rolls.

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: _20_ (4d8 + 2) piercing damage.

**Blood Drain.** A target grappled by the bloodhunger takes _5_ (2d4) hit points at the start of each of the bloodhunger's turns due to blood loss.
