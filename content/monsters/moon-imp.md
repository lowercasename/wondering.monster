Moon Imps are tiny misshapen orbs of moon rock with small clawed legs and twisted faces, resembling miniscule rotund gargoyles. They tend to circle around the heads of worshippers of Obarax, with more powerful beings attracting more Moon Imps. When their masters are under threat, they fire thin, silvery rays of concentrated moonlight from their mouths.

A living creature struck by a Moon Impâ€™s beam is dealt 1d6 damage and must succeed in a DC 11 Intelligence saving throw or be dazed by keening whispers and flickering lights, which incur disadvantage on all rolls until the end of their next turn.
