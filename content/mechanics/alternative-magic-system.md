I've been thinking through a kind of sympathetic magic/balance of energies system which is a bit less flashy and more freeform than Vancian magic, but isn't completely divorced from that sort of fantastic form of magic. It may not be what you want though!

\- Magic involves moving energy into and out of living things and objects.

\- This energy always ends up somewhere, and can never be created or destroyed, only moved.

1\. To cast magic, pick a **recipient** and a **source** you can see. Your recipient and source can be **yourself**, a **living** or **inanimate** object, or **the Ambient**.

2\. If your spell isn't consensual, your source can roll to prevent the energy leaving them. Inanimate objects have static roll totals, probably based on size.
