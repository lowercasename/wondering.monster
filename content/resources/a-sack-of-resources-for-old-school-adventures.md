This weekend I'm running a one-shot adventure for a group of friends, and in pursuit of a D&D-esque system which would get out of the way, but also give that feeling of weird glorious number-crunching corner-peeking treasure-hoisting spider-escaping potion-slurping joy I remember from my first games with D&D 3rd Edition in high school, I discovered Ben Milton's perfect confection [_Knave_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave). Milton seems to be a big name in the OSR community, to which I am only a newcomer. All I can say is that _Knave_, and Milton's other game [_Maze Rats_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats), just really hit that system sweet spot for me. I think it might be because Milton plays his games with high schoolers. They still feel electric, y'know?

After discovering _Knave_, I went on a rampage through the TRPG Internet, and in the interests of being able to return to these things myself, here's my treasure hoard, my haul. I'm expecting a lot of XP when I drag this sack back into town, believe me.

#### Games

* [_Labyrinth Lord_](http://goblinoidgames.com/index.php/downloads/), a huge and wonderfully comprehensive emulation of the [D&D Basic Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set) and [D&D Expert Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Expert_Set) of the 1980s.
* [_Basic Fantasy RPG_](https://basicfantasy.org/), an old-school style open source system
* [_Low Fantasy Gaming_](https://lowfantasygaming.com/), another old-school style system but one specifically designed to emulate a low-magic world
* [_Knave Rats_](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/9smybh/knave_rats_my_favorite_parts_of_knave_and_maze/), a fusion of Milton's _Knave_ and _Maze Rats_ by u/Kalahan
* [12 Micro RPGs on 2 sheets of paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/9d59mx/i_put_12_micro_rpgs_on_2_sheets_of_paper/), compiled by u/Kalahan
* [_Stonetop_, a "hearth fantasy" hack of _Dungeon World_ by Jeremy Strandberg, still in development](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/stonetop.html). The ideas are brilliant, new, and beautiful, and I'm so excited for it. It's also being published by Lampblack & Brimstone, who make Good Things.

#### _Knave_ specific

* [A Bestiary for _Knave_](http://natetreme.com/blog/2019/2/20/a-bestiary-for-knave) by Nate Treme of Highland Paranormal Society
* [A bestiary of monsters from Irish folklore](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/bfuu2i/i_adapted_some_monsters_and_creatures_from_irish/), also adapted for Knave by u/Kerbobotat
* [Lawbreaker](https://lawbreaker.herokuapp.com/), a Knave character generator
* [An alternative and gorgeous character sheet for _Knave_](https://github.com/catnipped/knave-character-sheet) by Ossian Bor√©n
* [_Knave_ on 1 sheet of paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/9elnn9/i_put_knave_on_1_sheet_of_paper_for_all_your/), compiled by u/Kalahan. Very handy.
* [A massive collection of neat hacks, embellishments, and extensions for _Knave_](https://buildingsarepeople.blogspot.com/2018/08/knave-mini-review-hacks-additions-and.html) by Buildings Are People (also a great blog for OSR goodness)
* [_Glaive_, another set of _Knave_ hacks and optional rules](https://campingwithowlbears.blogspot.com/2019/12/glaive-knave-hack-collection-of-house.html) by Camping with Owlbears.
* [_Rakehell_, an original, dark adventure and setting zine for _Knave_](https://goatmansgoblet.itch.io/rakehell-1), beautifully written in High Weird. Reminds me of one of my favourite video games, [Caves of Qud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/). Now there's a setting worth playing.

#### Rules

* [Overloading the Encounter Die by Necropraxis](https://www.necropraxis.com/2014/02/03/overloading-the-encounter-die/), a rule for more interesting and dynamic exploration that I look forward to trying out. It's incorporated into the ruleset by Buildings Are People, I think.

#### Dungeons

* [The Quintessential Dungeon](http://beholderpie.blogspot.com/2016/05/one-page-dungeon-2016-quintessential.html), a perfect, charming, and gorgeously drawn one-page dungeon by Beholder Pie, which feels to me like being in high school again.
* [Tomb of the Serpent Kings by Coins and Scrolls](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-tomb-of-serpent-kings-megapost.html), a 'tutorial' dungeon ideal for new players which cleverly teaches the basics of D&D.

#### Monsters

* [Goblin Punch's Bestiary](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-bestiary.html), over _two hundred and seventy_ new monsters. That's a whole new _Monster Manual_.
* [Some good advice and links to more resources on creating OSR monsters](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/5g5w9p/process_for_creating_osr_monster_stats/)
* [The frankly absolutely essential _Monster Menu-All_](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/07/monster-menu-all-part-1-eating-ad.html) by Coins and Scrolls, a fully developed guidebook for cooking and eating every single monster in the 1977 _AD&D Monster Manual_.
* [An automated visual monster concept generator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vtbib9wSVkbmEwsL3oaX8GKLASzXrHLCMPL0aHWt3Js/edit#gid=815527111) based on [Michael Raston's Fantastical Beast Generator](http://lizardmandiaries.blogspot.com/2016/10/fantastic-beast-visual-generator-roll.html), to force us to think outside every box.

#### Items, treasure, herbs, &c.

* [_Treasure_ by Courtney Campbell](http://angband.oook.cz/steamband/Treasure.pdf), a complete overhaul of the old-school D&D treasure system full of imaginative, evocative, and realistic items - so damn good.
* [The Loot Table, by Kelvin Green, remixed by the venerable Dyson](https://dysonlogos.blog/2015/01/18/the-loot-table/). Roll dice, get loot - ideal, quick, and fun.
* [A simple and straightforward set of random treasure tables](http://lizardmandiaries.blogspot.com/2017/09/random-treasure-table.html) which likewise do much to make rolling for treasure not a chore, by Michael Raston.
* The comprehensive, imaginative, absolutely quite lovely and strange [_Herb & Plant Generator_ by d4caltrops](https://drive.google.com/file/d/134BW-1RX0yA9frUoWdEqr-owIYmlRRQh/view). Use it!
* [A whole slew of really good DM aids by Dungeons and Possums](https://dungeonspossums.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html), including my absolute favourite, the ['Stop Making Boring Gems' chart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cidy9ZUZQ2-Urd6NGN5IPpC-BWQsojzf/view), complete with color synonyms, jewels sorted by color, and a glossary of gem cuts.
* [_Alchemy & Oozes_ by Goblin Punch](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog-alchemy-and-oozes.html), a brilliant, frankly necessary collection of potions for old-school D&D. Cleverly, the 'basic 20' potions are numbered 1-20 on the list of 100, which I really appreciate.
* [A thread of 'best tables at the table'](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/ay9ec4/best_tables_at_the_table/) with lots of great links.

#### Magic

* [_Wonder & Wickedness_ by Lost Pages](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145647/Wonder--Wickedness), a level-less magic system. Looks intersting, but I haven't looked through it yet. Level-less magic systems are always the way to go anyway!

#### Character building

* [200 Failed Medieval Careers by 10 Foot Polemic](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html) (a particularly wonderful blog title), everything you'll ever need to discover who you were before you became the sort of person who spends all their afternoons running away from spiders.

#### Tools and utilities

* [Mipui](https://www.mipui.net/), a dungeon mapping tool.

#### Art

* [The FreeD&DArt Repository](https://get.google.com/albumarchive/102628334940070915254), lovingly collected, beautiful and creepy **public domain** old-school-style art, from where I derived the little fellow in this blog's sidebar.
* [A list of all the fonts that TSR used for their books](https://www.kirith.com/tsr-fonts/), for us typography nerds.
